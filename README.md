Open Data Kit (ODK) is a free and open-source set tools which help organizations author, field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. ODK provides an out-of-the-box solution for users to:

* [Build](https://opendatakit.org/use/build/) a data collection form or survey;
* [Collect](https://opendatakit.org/use/collect/) the data on a mobile device and send it to a server; and
* [Aggregate](https://opendatakit.org/use/aggregate/) the collected data on a server and extract it in useful formats. 

In addition to socio-economic and health surveys with GPS locations and images, ODK is being used to create decision support for clinicians and for building multimedia-rich nature mapping tools. See [featured deployments](https://opendatakit.org/about/deployments/) and [list of tools](https://opendatakit.org/about/tools/) for more examples of what the ODK community is doing. We welcome and encourage [participation](https://opendatakit.org/participate/) from the user community.

Downloads of the tools are available at [Downloads](https://opendatakit.org/downloads/).
